# Use cases beyond documentation

STE was built for aircraft maintenance manuals. The same properties — one meaning per word, short sentences, condition-first commands — transfer to any text where misreading has a cost. Its registered users spread well beyond aerospace and defense for that reason.

Each case below names the mode and the adaptations.

## Error messages and CLI output

Mode: procedural. This is the highest-value target: an error message is a 2 a.m. instruction to a stressed reader.

Pattern: state what happened (past simple), state the cause if known, give the command or condition to fix it.

> **Before:** Oops! Something went wrong while attempting to establish a connection. Please ensure your credentials are properly configured and try again.
> **After:** Connection to the database failed. The password for user `app` was not correct. Set `DB_PASSWORD` and connect again.

Never invent the cause. If the cause is unknown, say what the program did and what the reader can inspect: "The upload failed after three retries. Read the log at `/var/log/mailgate.log`."

## Runbooks and standard operating procedures

Mode: strict-leaning procedural. This is STE's home turf — an on-call runbook is a maintenance manual.

- Every step imperative, one instruction per step, conditions first.
- Warnings before the step, risk word first, then the command, then the risk.
- 20-word limit enforced hard: an operator under pager stress reads each sentence once.
- Order steps so that the system is in a safe state after every step. A rotation procedure creates the replacement credential before it revokes the old one. If the order you were given breaks this, use the safe order, open with the warning, and report the change.

## Incident reports and postmortems

Mode: descriptive. Simple past only — a timeline in present perfect ("we have identified...") hides when things happened.

> **Before:** We have identified an issue that may have impacted some users' ability to access the service.
> **After:** Between 14:02 and 14:31 UTC, 12% of requests failed. A deploy at 14:00 removed the cache warmup step.

STE bans hedges ("may have impacted") — the report states what is known and says "unknown" for the rest. This reads more honest because it is. Do not let the ban on hedges turn an uncertain cause into a certain one: "The cause is unknown" is the compliant sentence.

## Commit messages and PR descriptions

Mode: descriptive body, imperative subject. Convention already matches STE: imperative subject line, plain past facts in the body. Apply the substitution table and the 25-word limit to the body. Delete "this PR aims to".

## API changelogs and release notes

Mode: descriptive. One entry, one change, one sentence where possible. "Breaking:" entries follow the warning pattern — command first: "Update your calls to `v2/users`. The `name` field split into `first_name` and `last_name`."

Keep every version number, deprecation date, and affected endpoint. These are exactly the facts a shorter sentence tends to lose.

## Instructions for AI agents (prompts, AGENTS.md, skills)

Mode: procedural. A system prompt is a procedure executed by a reader with no ability to ask questions — the exact reader STE was designed for.

- One instruction per sentence keeps rules independently quotable and hard to half-follow.
- One word, one meaning prevents the model from treating "check", "verify", and "validate" as three different operations.
- Condition-first ("If the build fails, stop") beats trailing conditions, which models drop.
- No "should" — a model reads "should" as optional. Write "must" or delete the rule.

## Agent-to-agent text (tool descriptions, inter-agent messages, status reports)

Mode: descriptive, with procedural rules for anything the receiver must act on. The receiving agent has no back-channel: it cannot ask whether "close the valve" is a command or a description of a nearby valve.

- Name the actor in every sentence. "The tool returns the artifact", not "the artifact is returned".
- Give every pronoun an explicit referent, or repeat the noun. Prefer "this response" over bare "this".
- One instruction per sentence, so a receiver that follows half the message still follows whole instructions.
- State the failure branch as its own sentence: "If the strategy does not allow automatic resolution, the tool reports the conflict."

## Support macros and status-page updates

Mode: descriptive, 25-word limit. Non-native readers are the majority of many user bases. No "we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused" — "The API was down for 18 minutes. Uploads made during this time were saved and will process today."

## Translation and localization prep

Mode: strict. STE's original purpose was making English readable for non-native maintenance crews, and it doubles as pre-editing for machine translation. One meaning per word plus complete grammar (articles, "that") removes most translation ambiguity. If your docs get localized, STE cuts the error rate and the cost.

## UI copy and empty states

Mode: procedural, hard length limits. Buttons and labels are technical names (exempt). Body copy follows the rules: "No projects yet. Create a project to start." Nothing else survives at this length anyway.

## Where STE does not fit

Marketing pages, launch posts, blog voice, brand writing. STE deletes persuasion on purpose. Write those in your own voice — then use STE for the docs the landing page links to.
